# Personal Blog Web App - Express, React, Tailwind, JWT Auth

This project consists of three key components:
1. A Node Express.js based REST API that serves HTTP endpoints for the front end applications
2. A consumer React based web application where users are able to read posts made by Admins and comment on posts if they log in
3. An Admin dashboard, where Admins can perform CRUD operations on the database (create, read, update and delete posts, users and comments)
